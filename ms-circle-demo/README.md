# Calculate Area of Circle Demo

Simple SPA web page that allows the user to calculate the area of a circle given a radius. Demonstrates react-bootstrap, redux, and react-router. REQUIRES calc service (ms-geometry-service) to be running (currently running on heroku, see below).

# Technologies: React-Bootstrap, Redux, React Router & Redux Thunk

Based on the following tutorial:

* Tutorial: [Getting started with create-react-app, Redux, React Router & Redux Thunk](https://medium.com/@notrab/getting-started-with-create-react-app-redux-react-router-redux-thunk-d6a19259f71f)


## Installation

>git clone https://github.com/alturium/ms-circle-project.git

>npm start

Currently, the project is hardwired to access a running version of the backend service "ms-geometry-service" at https://fathomless-everglades-97176.herokuapp.com.

In addition, a proxy to the backend was added to the package.json to avoid CORS issues.
